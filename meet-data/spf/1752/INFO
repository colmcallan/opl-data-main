The reporting for this meet was terrible.

The data comes from a combination of:

1) Full-power sheets -- but that did not log non-SBD events, for example Cailer Woolam's record pull.

2) The SPF website, which does not distinguish between 3rd and 4th attempts, did not report Raw vs Wraps, and eliminated all DQ'd lifters.

The final entries.csv is cobbled together from these two sources.
