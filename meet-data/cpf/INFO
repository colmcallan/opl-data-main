The CPF has three classes of lifters:
 - Raw (this does not allow sleeves or wraps)
 - Raw Assisted (sleeves or wraps)
 - Equipped (multi-ply)

Alastair MacNicol clarified that the "Raw Assisted" division is for both wraps and sleeves,
and the "Raw" division is for "100% Raw". This is apparently common for the WPC sanction.

CPF does have a 140+ weightclass, although sometimes some meets use 125+.
