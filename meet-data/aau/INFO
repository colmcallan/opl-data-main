The AAU holds meets with a large variety of event types, only some of
which correspond to powerlifting.

Their main results page doesn't actually seem to include any results,
but they seem to post PDFs to a secondary results page that is much
more easily scraped.

They only have Raw and Single-ply divisions. No Wraps or Multi-ply.
