Chris Spegal pulled 915 at this meet for what was intended to be the American Raw record, however he was wearing spandex briefs so we are counting it as a single-ply deadlift.

Spegal's deadlift was not listed in the original result file, but by comparing the videos of Spegal's deadlift (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-lOl9OoX3s) and Jake Norman's 900lb deadlift at this meet (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyhWy2iRdJw) you can see that he pulled 915 at this meet.
