This meet was held in north San Diego county 2 weeks following the most devastating wild fires in California
history. By meet day the fires had left a significant imprint on the surrounding mountains but rains had cleared
the skies of smoke and ash, providing a pleasant fall day for lifting. 46 competitors from California and a few
as far away as Washington and Nevada. Dr. Larry Maile, USAPL president began with opening remarks and
a briefing of the rules. Highlights of the Bench Press event were national level competitor Kim Aaneneson
pressing 204 lbs in the 114 class, 19 year old sensation Eric Johnson hitting 440 lbs in the 275 class, and
not to be out done, the ageless wonder Alvin Waldon went to battle in a cotton T-shirt and hitting a 462 lb BP
to win best lifter in Men's Open and Masters divisions. In the Powerlifting event 26 year old Rob Meulenberg
posted a qualifying total of 1748 to earn his first trip to Men's Nationals in Baton Rouge. Greg Buffington
continues to make gains getting PR's in his Squat & Bench, posting a 1626 total to win the 198 Open class
in addition to the Men's Open best lifter award. Bob Strange and Danny Herrera set numerous Masters
American records. Christina Henesian set a Junior American Deadlift record with a 352 lb lift in the 60 Kg
class. But the clear star was World Team member Priscilla Ribic who used this competition for a tune up
in preparation for Women's Nationals. She weighed in a tick above the 148 class and was a very light
165 class lifter. Priscilla made an American record with a 457 lb Squat on her opener and surpassed the
Deadlift benchmark with a 503 lb American record on the way to setting a new American Total record of
1256 lbs. Everyone in attendance was impressed by her exceptional lifting performance. Perhaps the most
inspirational lifting was provided by the Special Olympian team led by Doug Sampson who earned a Silver
Medal at the Special Olympics World Summer Games. Sincere appreciation goes to the atheletes,
spectators, and the dedicated group of volunteers who helped make the meet a success. Thanks also to
John Inzer and the staff at Inzer Advance Designs, Rick Brewer of of House Of Pain Ironwear, Steve and
Lisa Denison for providing the Ivanko competition weight set & scales, and Joe & Nance Avigliano of Los
Angeles Lifting Club who donated a truckload of plates, bars and benches for the warm-up area.
