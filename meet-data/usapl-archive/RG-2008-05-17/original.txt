  Thank you to everyone who assisted and supported us at our recent USAPL event! I want to express my heartfelt gratitude
  for everyone’s support once again. We had a total of 70 lifters (including dual entries) from MA, CT, RI, NH, ME & NY and
  witnessed some pretty amazing lifting across the board. We were able to present Fred Archambault of NH with a Lifetime
  Achievement Award which was a moving tribute to Fred, who at 85 years young continues to amaze us with his lifting
  prowess. Fred is a true gentleman and an inspiration to us all and it is an honor to have him compete in our USAPL events.
  Tom Kerrigan of CT was kind enough to provide 2 DVD copies of the presentation to Fred of which we have sent one copy
  to him.

  I can’t thank Joe A., Tom W. and Joe W. enough for their tireless efforts in the judge’s chairs! They were not only consistent
  but fair throughout the long day. Rene and the Next Level crew were awesome in manning the platform and Liane, Art and
  the one80 crew did a fantastic job too. Eric continues to provide one of the best state USAPL websites out there and this is a
  tremendous resource for all of our lifters. My wife Kathy did a fantastic job as always in making sure that the meet program,
  meet paperwork and lifter gift bags were ready to go come meet day. Each lifter received a gift bag that contained
  Powerlifting USA magazines as well as Con-Cret and Amino-Activ samples that were provided by Promera Health. Each
  best lifter received a $20 gift certificate from our other sponsor, House of Pain.

  These meets require not one person, but a “team” of committed, dedicated individuals to ensure that we provide our lifters the
  best lifting experience possible. I am truly blessed to have all of you helping me to carry the torch and continue the path that
  my “powerlifting father” Joe Zarella started before me. Joe was NE Powerlifting for over 25 years until I began running
  events in May of 1979. Our recent event marked my 29th year of organizing and running powerlifting events. I would not
  have accomplished this feat without everyone who has been generous enough to assist me throughout the years. I look
  forward to seeing everyone in November on the 22nd. I hope that everyone has a safe and enjoyable summer!

                                                                                      God Bless,

                                                                                      Yours in Powerlifting,

                                                                                      Greg Kostas
                                                                                      USAPL MA State Chairman
